# Haskell JSON parser

This is simple recursive decent parser for JSON I hacked together in Haskell in an afteroon just for the fun of it.

The developer experience of using Haskell for this kind of programming task is second to none, at least if you have a graps of basic type classes like functor, applicative and monad.

This is the third JSON parser I've coded (the others where made in Kotlin and Clojure) and
the Haskell one was by far the most fun to do.
